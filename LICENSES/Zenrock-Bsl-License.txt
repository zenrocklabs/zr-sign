MERCHANTIBILITY,   FITNESS   FOR   A   PARTICULAR   PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
7. Limitation   on   Liability. EXCEPT   TO   THE   EXTENT   REQUIRED   BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL FOUNDATION BE LIABLE TO YOU ON
ANY   LEGAL   THEORY   FOR   ANY   SPECIAL,   INCIDENTAL,   CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE
USE   OF   THE   LICENSED   SOFTWARE,   EVEN   IF   FOUNDATION   HAS   BEEN
ADVISED   OF   THE   POSSIBILITY   OF   SUCH   DAMAGES.   GENERATE
BIOMEDICINE’S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS LICENSE TO YOU WILL NOT
EXCEED $100.
8.General. You may not assign or transfer this License, by operation of law or
otherwise, without Foundation’s prior written consent, and any attempt by
you to do so, without such consent, will be void. Subject to the foregoing,
this License is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of each of the
parties   and   their   respective   successors   and   permitted   assigns.   If   any
provision   of   this   License   is   held   invalid,   illegal   or   unenforceable,   that
provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, given
the fundamental intentions of the parties, and the remaining provisions of
this License will remain in full force and effect. This License is the complete
and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to its subject
matter   and   supersedes   all   prior   or   contemporaneous   agreements,
communications and understandings, both written and oral, with respect to
its subject matter. This License may be amended or modified only by a
written   document   executed   by   duly   authorized   representatives   of   the
parties. Nothing in this License will be construed to create a partnership,
joint venture or agency relationship between the parties. Neither party will
have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other’s behalf
without such other party’s prior written consent. Except as expressly set
forth in this License, the exercise by either party of any remedy under this
License will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this License or
otherwise. Either party’s failure to enforce any provision of this License will
not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.
No waiver of any provision of this License will be effective unless it is in
writing and signed by the party granting the waiver. This License will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Cayman Islands
without giving effect to any principles of conflict of laws that would lead to
the   application   of   the   laws   of   another   jurisdiction.   This   License   will   be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman
Islands,   without   regard   to   or   application   of   conflicts   of   law   rules   or
principles. Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or
relating   to   this   License,   including   the  existence,   validity,   interpretation,
performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-
contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and
finally resolved by binding arbitration to be by the Cayman International
Mediation & Arbitration Centre (CI-MAC) and governed by the Arbitration Act
(as amended) of the Cayman Islands. The arbitration shall be conducted in
the English language and the place of arbitration shall be in the Cayman
Islands. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The decision of the sole
arbitrator to any such dispute, controversy, difference or claim shall be final
and binding upon both parties. If any litigation or arbitration is necessary to
enforce the terms of this License, the prevailing party will be entitled to
have their attorney fees paid by the other party. Each party waives any right
it may have to assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens, to assert that it
is not subject to the jurisdiction of such arbitration or courts or to object to
venue to the extent any proceeding is brought in accordance herewith.
